# Developer Assisatant v0.1

The goal of the project is to convert voice command into a snippet of code or terminal command to facilitate repeated coding tasks. 
Like doing git push or implementing a TCP Client.

## Area of Applications

1- As a platform to learn algorithms fundamentals without being bored by staying on theoric aspects or wasting concentration on understanding the new programming language implementation.
Since the implementation of voice command will be independent of programming languages, the beginner can concentrate on the algorithmic aspects without being blocked to implement his simple idea in any language.

2- As an assistant for developers to gain time to implement repeated snippet of code and uploading their code to the host server. 
In fact, having the ability to implement some code without fixing the work screen from time to time, allow developers to avoid many eye syndroms and 
increase their productivity. 
 
### Demo

Only the examples showed in the Demo are working at this stage, this exmaples are just a start point.

### Installing

- instal the project
- add jars build path for the of lib repository
- change the SrcPath in the "WorkingFile.java" Class to the file you want to write in.


```
static private String SrcPath = "/home/ghada/eclipse-workspace/Test/src/Main.java";
```

## Built With

* Java
* Sphinx API 5 (https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/tutoriallm/)
* Mary TTS 5.2 


## Next Steps

* add Git command actions
* Having the pessobility to delete and choose a line to write (by default it writes in order only for the initialisation of the table, it follows his definition)
* write big code snippet from files librairy like TCP Client / server.
