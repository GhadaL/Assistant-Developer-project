# Developer Assisatant v0.1

The goal of the project is to convert voice command into a snippet of code or terminal command to facilitate repeated coding tasks. 
Like doing git push or implementing a TCP Client.

## Area of Applications

1- As a platform to learn algorithms fundamentals without being bored by staying on theoric aspects or wasting concentration on understanding the new programming language implementation.
Since the implementation of voice command will be independent of programming language, the beginner can concentrate on the algorithmic aspects without being blocked to implement his simple idea in any language.

2- As an assistant for developers to gain time to implement repeated snippet of code and uploading their code to the host server. in fact, having the ability to implement some code without the need of
